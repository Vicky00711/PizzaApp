## Pizza Application ##
Welcome to the pizza application, which is made using Java as main language. I tried to implment the main functionality where the user/client can select their own sauce, toppings, size and pizza type. 
Below you will find more information about the project.

## About the project ##
The main idea of creating this application was to learn about system design and architecture. I have used bridge design pattern to create the complete project. The reason for choosing bridge design pattern was simple 
as it follows single responsibility principle which will help me maintaing, reusing testing and also extending the code in the future. Bridge design pattern also has composition relationship which seperates abstraction from 
the implementation of the interface classes, this means concrete interface classes are independent of concrete abstract classes which means it follow open closed principle (open for extension but closed for modification). 
The project helped me deeply understand the core principle of object oriented programming (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism and Inheritance).
